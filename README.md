# 🧑‍💼 Employee Data Analysis

This project is a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of an employee dataset using **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Seaborn**. The goal is to clean the data, handle missing values and outliers, perform feature engineering, and extract meaningful insights through visualizations.

## 📂 Project Overview

- ✅ Loaded and explored an employee dataset  
- 🧹 Cleaned data by handling **null values** and **outliers**  
- 🧠 Performed **feature engineering** to improve data quality  
- 📊 Created **visualizations** to uncover key patterns and insights:  
  - Histogram  
  - Box plot  
  - Count plot  
- 📌 Extracted insights about employee attributes, trends, and potential anomalies

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** – numerical computations
- **Seaborn** – statistical data visualization  
- **Matplotlib** - for ploting the charts

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains information about employees, such as:

- Age  
- Department  
- Salary  
- Experience  
- Gender  
- ...and more  

*Note: Replace this with actual columns or a link to the dataset if public.*

## 🔍 Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed null or missing values
   - Detected and handled outliers using statistical techniques

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created new features from existing columns
   - Transformed data for better analysis

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Used visualizations to understand distributions and relationships
   - Plotted:
     - **Histograms** – distribution of numerical features
     - **Box plots** – detection of outliers
     - **Count plots** – frequency of categorical values

4. **Insights**
   - Identified trends across departments and age groups
   - Highlighted gender distribution and salary patterns
   - Uncovered anomalies and data inconsistencies

## 📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates a standard EDA workflow for an employee dataset, covering data cleaning, feature enhancement, and rich visual analysis. It serves as a great foundation for further modeling or business intelligence.
